# Java Sockets exercise

This is the starting point for exercise on Java Sockets.
It is composed of two modules:
- [server](server/) - program that opens a socket and awaits for requests to process
- [client](client/) - program that opens a connection to the server and sends a request

See the README for each module.
Start at the [server](server/README.md) and then go to the [client](client/README.md).
